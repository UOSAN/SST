# Task Output
## Stimuli and Response on same matrix, pre-determined

    - **Column 1** is trial number;
    - **Column 2** is the numchunks number (1-NUMCHUNKS)
    - **Column 3**; 0 = Go, 1 = NoGo; 2 is null, 3 is no-trial
    - **Column 4** is 0=left, 1=right arrow; 2 is null
    - **Column 5** is the ladder number (1-2)
    - **Column 6** is the value currently in "LadderX", corresponding to SSD
    - **Column 7** is subject response (no response is 0)
    - **Column 8** is ladder movement (-1 for down, +1 for up, 0 for N/A)
    - **Column 9** is the reaction time (sec)
    - **Column 10** is the actual SSD (for error-check)
    - **Column 11** is the actual SSD plus time taken to run the command
    - **Column 12** is absolute time since beginning of task that trial begins
    - **Column 13** is the time elapsed since the beginning of the block at moment when arrows are shown
    - **Column 14** is the actual SSD for error check (time from arrow displayed to beep played)
    - **Column 15** is the duration of the trial from trialcode
    - **Column 16** is the time_course from trialcode
